Below is a list of my projects or projects I contribute to.

# Other Projects
These are some other open source projects I contribute to or help out in the communities on.

## Mycroft AI
Help out quite a bit on this project when I can and I spend a lot of time in the community channel.  I am currently building a chatbot for the Mattermost community to answer questions.
Was also previously on the Skills team for Mycroft AI and helped approve skills that were sent into the skills repo.

[Mycroft AI Docker](https://github.com/MycroftAI/docker-mycroft) - I help maintain and run the docker image for mycroft.  I have pumped a lot of time into this project and have helped it grow into what it is today.

[Mycroft Home Assistant Skill](https://github.com/btotharye/mycroft-homeassistant) - I have helped to grow out this skill and get more people contributing.  This is the official Mycroft Home Assistant Skill for managing Home Assistant installations via Mycroft with Voice.

## Rasa
Also use [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) a lot for chatbot development and currently developing a chatbot framework with Rasa.  I help out in the community when I can and just recently created a [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/) connector in Python to allow it to be used with mattermost.

## Articulate
[Articulate](https://github.com/samtecspg/articulate) is a really cool new UI and way of creating bots and training them.  I am working on helping contribute to the docker setup and tweak it some.  I plan to use it on some of my own projects.


## My Projects
[Cisco Partner Support API Chatbot](https://github.com/btotharye/cisco-pss-api-chatbot) - This is a menu driven chatbot I built that uses the [Cisco Support APIs](https://developer.cisco.com/site/support-apis/) to lookup Cisco serial numbers currently as well as contract/warranty information.  It will give you the recommended code as well. I plan to add the other API functionality to it soon.

[Lackey AI (Might Change)](https://github.com/lackeyai) - Currently building out pieces to get a new chatbot framework setup.  Will allow you to train bots via different methods Rasa, Dialogflow, etc and then connect these bots to connectors like slack, mattermost, twitter, etc.
