A [`gatsby`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)-based blog.

## Key settings

`config.toml` contains key data you'll want to change first. The location of the blog, author name and details, and so on.

`piwik.js` is excluded from the repository, but is used by `html.js` (to generate piwik tracking tags) and `scripts/update_rankings.js` (to get popularity numbers for posts). These four keys are required to use those features:

```javascript
export default {
  url: 'usually something like "http://domain/piwik.php"',
  id: 'the site number',
  js: 'where to load your js from like "http://domain/piwik.js"',
  token: 'your API access token, used by `update-rankings` npm script',
  domain: 'used only for update-rankings task; like http://domain'
};
```

`mailchimp.js` is also excluded from the repository, used by the `<EmailSignup>` React component in displaying its form. It uses five keys:

```javascript
export default {
  account: 'your account name, the first part of your mailchimp links',
  shard: 'the second component of your mailchimp links - like "us12"',
  u: 'the "u" value in your embedded mailchimp form',
  id: 'the "id" value in your embedded mailchimp form',
  fakeField: 'the field for robots in the embedded mailchimp form',
};
```

_Note: if you don't want to use these features, put empty files at
`/piwik.js` and `/mailchimp.js` (like `export default {};`) to make things work until you take the unused code out._

## Develop

```bash
npm run develop
```

This runs `gatsby`'s hot-reloading development server on http://localhost:8000. It will have to be restarted if you rename, add, or remove files because [`webpack`](https://webpack.github.io/)'s watch mode doesn't handle those kinds of filesystem changes.

## Build

Generate files to `public/` folder. Will fail if there are outstanding `git` changes. Pre-gzips all files. Calls a shell script behind the scenes, so you might run into some problems on Windows.

```bash
npm run build-production # or npm run build-staging
npm run build-production -- --force # build even with outstanding git changes
```

## Test

Run `eslint` and the unit tests with `npm test`. All utility code and React components will be tested in Node.js. `npm run unit` will just run the tests, and `unit-watch` and `unit-coverage` are also available for active development. Once you've generated code coverage numbers, `npm run open-coverage` makes it easy to open [`istanbul`](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)'s HTML report.

You can use `npm run serve` to serve static files from `public/` at http://localhost:8000 for manual and automated tests. A manual test script is available at `tests/manual.txt` - it covers the parts of the user experience without automated tests.

Once you have the static server running you can check for broken links:

```bash
npm run check-local-links
npm run check-external-links
npm run check-deep-links
npm run check-links http://localhost:8000/
```

_Note: Due to the meta tags on each page, you'll get broken links until you've published all pages to production._

## Helper scripts

```bash
npm run make-post -- "The name of your post"
```

Creates a new markdown file from the template at `scripts/util/_postTemplate.md`. Sets the new post's `previous` URL to the last most-recent post's URL, and updates the previous post's markdown file with the newly-generated posts URL. That was annoying to do by hand. :0)

```bash
npm run clean-post
npm run clean-post -- 5
```

By default processes the most recent file. If a number is provided, it will process that many most-recent posts. Removes smart quotes, duplicate links (same text as URL), and all mentions of the blog's `domain` (taken from `config.toml`) to ensure that links are all of the relative form.

```bash
npm run generate-tags
```

Loads all posts from `pages/posts` and extracts all of their tags. Ensures that a file `pages/tags/TAG.js` exists for every tag found. Prints out a count for each.

```bash
npm run update-rankings
```

Goes to my stats system (which uses [Piwik](https://piwik.org/)), grabs the top URLs, massages the data a little bit, then updates the `rank` property of the frontmatter in each markdown file. If you use this, you'll want to periodically change the end date for the query.

```bash
npm run generate-rss
```

Generates `rss.xml` and `atom.xml` into `public/`. Runs as part of every build.

```bash
npm run generate-json
```

Generates `all.json` and `recent.json` into `public/`. Also runs as part of every build. I generate this file for easier syndication into other sites, like https://scottnonnenberg.com.

## Contributing

This project uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to release new versions, automatically updating the version number and [changelog](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) based on commit messages in [standard format](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md). [`ghooks`](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks) and [`validate-commit-msg`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) are used to ensure all commit messages match the expected format (see [package.json](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/package.json) for the configuration details).

It takes some getting used to, but this configuration is absolutely worthwhile. A changelog is way easier to understand than the chaos of a raw commit stream, especially with `standard-version` providing direct links to bugs, commits and [commit ranges](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0).

## TODO

* Remove pinned `punycode` dependency when `broken-link-checker` updates to pull in newer version of `bhttp` and `tough-cookie`: https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/issues/34
* Remove pinned `babylon` dependency when `eslint-plugin-import` works with its most recent version once more: https://github.com/babel/babylon/issues/139
